# BeautifulGlaze
BeautifulGlaze is my personal expansion/version of the Crystalline Discord theme, at first I only planned to edit slightly for personal preferences in addition to some QOL changes but is starting to expand into an actual work, cleaning up the mess by SamuiNe and adding/changing some features. Not created with public use in mind but go ahead anyways.

# Requirements:
Having installed BeautifulDiscord

# Usage
Simply open a terminal in the folder you store this .css in and run "python -m beautifuldiscord --css BeautifulGlaze.css".

# Template
Credits to SamuiNe. Their file had a lot of features to build off of.
